# The data and code of blast furnace ironmaking

This is the code and data for the paper "A Survey of Data-Driven Soft Sensor Methods for Ironmaking Process: Datasets, Applications, and Opportunities".
The real-world data were collected from an iron and steel plant in South China with permission.

This work is inspired by the following papers:
